# Therm

[![macos-x64](https://github.com/trufae/Therm/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/trufae/Therm/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Therm is a fork of iTerm2 made by [pancake](https://infosec.exchange/@pancake) with minimalism in mind:

* Toggleable Notch guard on fullscreen windows (CMD+Shift+G)
* Better defaults (hidden tabs, scrollbars and window controls, dark theme, follow mouse, ...)
* Removed tons of barely-used and buggy features, gaining some performance and reducing size
* Fast fullscreen toggling, no animations (CMD+Enter)
* Resize splits with keystrokes (CMD+Shift+HJKL)
* Remove the AutoUpdates (Sparkle framework) and custom ANSI escape codes
* Search entry is now dark and toggleable with CMD+f
* Removed Brodcast, Tmux and SSH client functionality (buggy)
* Solid, non transparent and no blurry effects allowed. Faster, lighter and more readable.
* Added better default lfonts (Agave, Profont, Firacode, ...)
* Support AlwaysOnTop mode (CMD+Shift+F)
* Disable force-touch link previews, smart-paste and print-to-printer anoying features

## Installation

Download the latest build from the release page, Therm will never do network requests without your consent, so no auto-udpates, nobody in your network need to know which terminal are you using..

So, in order to get Therm installed in your system you can:

### Manual Installation

Find them out in [https://github.com/trufae/Therm/releases](https://github.com/trufae/Therm/releases)

Just drag and drop the .app into the `/Applications` and accept the certificate.

To resign the app with your certificate you can run this:

```
codesign -f -s 'J5PTVY8BHH' Therm.app/Contents/MacOS/Therm
```

### Using Brew

Maybe

```sh
brew install therm
```

### Source Build

To build it from source you just need to run `make run` or `open Therm.xcodeproj`.

## Future

Plan is to continue removing features and optimizing the code to make Therm even faster and cleaner.

* [ ] Keep removing features
* [ ] Remove all deprecated APIs uses
* [ ] Improve emoji support
* [ ] Support PowerPC and x86-32 macOS

## Settings

Reset your settings to start from scratch with these steps:

```sh
pkill Therm
rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.pancake.therm.plist
```

## Contributions

No plans to sync changes from iTerm2, except for maybe the Metal backend or better emoji support, but the software renderer is really fast and I can probably write a cleaner utf support from scratch.

I really value and appreciate all the work done by the author of <a href="https://iterm2.com">iTerm2</a>, so feel free to check it out and use it if you prefer.
