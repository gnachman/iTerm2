/*
 **  iTermGrowlDelegate.h
 **
 **  Copyright (c) 2006
 **
 **  Author: David E. Nedrow
 **
 **  Project: iTerm
 **
 **  Description: Implements the delegate for Growl notifications. When
 **      available, Notifiation Center is used as a fallback.
 **
 **  Usage:
 **      In your class header file, add the following @class directive
 **
 **          @class iTermGrowlDelegate;
 **
 **      and declare an iTermGrowlDelegate variable in the @interface
 **
 **          iTermGrowlDelegate* gd;
 **
 **      In your class implementation file, add the following import
 **
 **          #import "iTermGrowlDelegate.h"
 **
 **      In the class init, get a copy of the shared delegate
 **
 **          gd = [iTermGrowlDelegate sharedInstance];
 **
 **      There are several growlNotify methods in iTermGrowlDelegate.
 **      See the header file for details.
 **
 **      Example usage:
 **
 **          [gd growlNotify: @"This is the title"
 **          withDescription: @"This is the description"
 **          andNotification: @"Bells"];
