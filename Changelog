2009-06-11 delx
	* PTYTask spawns a separate thread to call select() on all the pipes.
	  Previously NSFileHandle would create a new thread of each pipe that
	  was being waited on.
	* This extra thread is used to perform read/write operations in 2048-byte
	  chunks from each pipe. This greatly improves interactivity.
	* Entering a different runloop mode no longer blocks PTYTask read/write
	  or drawing. Fixes #2682132
	* Automatically set the version number in target plist as part of the
	  xcode build phase. Dev versions get svn revisions & Deployment gets
	  the current date.

2009-06-09 delx
	* Always disable Apple's smooth scrolling to avoid drawing corruption
	* Fixed xterm window title reporting

2009-05-08 delx
	* PTYTextView now uses the Cocoa drawing machinery as Apple intended.
	  This means dirty flagged chars are converted into dirty rectangles.
	  No more forceUpdate, drawRect draws the rectangle it is given. It does
	  check needsToDrawRect for each line to avoid overdrawing.  This should
	  hopefully make drawing more reliable on Tiger and Leopard.
	* Selected text will now be invalidated only one of the characters in the
	  selection is changed.
	* The end result of these changes should be fast drawing on all OSes
	  with all the features of previous versions restored.
	* If no working directory is specified then new tabs will open in the
	  same directory as the previous session. This doesn't work with the
	  default settings yet. Need to execute the user's login shell directly
	  rather than using 'login -fp' to do it for us.
	* Clear the bell symbol upon any key press
	* Converted to XCode 3.1 project format and IB 3.0 XIBs
	* Report as xterm patch level 95 so Vim detects ttymouse=xterm2, also
	  increased default refresh rate.

2009-03-23 delx
	* Smarter placement of new terminal windows. It is aware of multiple
	  monitors as well as workspaces (Spaces). Windows are positioned on
	  screen so they have the smallest overlap with any other window.

2009-03-20 delx
	* charWidth is now set with ceil() rather than being truncated. This
	  should make wider characters fit correctly.
	* If char j on a line is dirty, force redraw of j+1 also. This ensures
	  that any subpixel rendering that is done does not leave trails on the
	  next character.

2009-03-16 delx
	* The cursor is now double-width when over a double-width character.
	* Fixed selection of wide chars after breaking it on 2009-03-13

2009-03-13  delx
	* Remove character caching code. Testing shows the drawing to run just
	  as fast without it. This reduces code complexity and colour reproduction
	  bug that was triggered by changing OSX's ColorSync calibration profiles,
	  eg when switching to a new monitor. It also makes operations that would
	  previously have required clearing the cache happen faster.
	* Fixed high density background colors:
	  $ echo -ne '\e[46m LD \e[106m HI \e[00m\n'
	* Refactored the selection handling. It no longer touches VT100Screen,
	  instead keeping a copy of the start & end points of the current and last
	  drawn selection. This saves [PTYTextView drawRect] from having to treat
	  all characters in the scrollback buffer as dirty.

2009-03-07  delx
	* Dramatically improve scrolling speed, iTerm no longer redraws the
	  whole terminal when scrolled, only the lines that have changed
	* Scroll on new input stops/starts on pushing home/end respectively
	* Set magic defaults to allow antialiasing on small fonts. Previously
	  even if antialiasing was enabled in iTerm, OSX would force it off
	  for smaller fonts. You can do this manually from the Info panel.
	* Cleaned up [PTYTextView drawRect]

2008-10-16	fabian

	* Improved URL handling for ssh/ftp/telnet
		1.  If there is no handler specified, iTerm will launch ssh/ftp/telnet using the 
			default OS X program with default session settings.
		2.  You can also specify a url handler bookmark, and put $$ as its command. Then 
			iTerm will use the default OS X program with customized terminal/display/keyboard 
			settings.
		3.	The old way still works.
	* iTerm no longer sends a growl alert for a bell event if the winodw is the key window.

	  the front session or window.
	* Icons updated.
	* Fixed a bug in [VT100Screen resizeWidth:Height] that might be the source of many crashes.
	* Added ability to parse URL for URL handlers. The following macros can be used in handler's command:
		$$URL$$, $$HOST$$, $$USER$$, $$PASSWORD$$, $$PORT$$, $$PATH$$
	  For example, a bookmark's command is: telnet -l $$USER$$ $$HOST$$ $$PORT$$, and the
	  URL is: telnet://joe@fancyland.com:23
	  This will give you this command: telnet -l joe fancyland.com 23
	  The URL will no longer be passed to a session by default, unless you specify one of those 6 macros
	  in your command line.
	* Now iTerm offers to become the default handler when you connect a URL scheme to a session. No undo.

    * Added a double check for scrollback size. Avoid crash when scrollback is too large.  

2006-10-09  fabian

      pressed, iTerm will first check keyboard profile, if it doesn't find anything, it 
      checks termcap. If the key is defined in termcap, use the termcap definition. 
      Otherwise, the standard vt100/xterm definition is used.

2006-03-01	ujwal

	* Fixed bug in PTYTextView:-drawRect in calculation of foreground color.

2006-02-28	ujwal

	  color, and background color.

2006-02-23	ujwal

	* Using separate thread in PTYSession to process data read from file descriptor in PTYTask. When data is read, the

	  the STREAM and processes data.

2006-02-06  fabian

    * Updated website files for the new release.

2006-02-06	dnedrow

2005-04-16	ujwal

	* All key input is checked for mapping.
	* Preferences are saved to disk on hitting OK.

2005-04-09	ujwal

	* Removed bouncing icon feature. Not a good idea for a terminal.
	* Incorporated Geoff Reedy's patch for xterm mouse reporting with minor changes.
	* Incorporated Rob Warner's patch to toggle transparency.

	* Re-implemented sorting of encoding list using user supplied patch.
	* Cleaning up zombie process after terminating session.
	* 0.8.1 release

2005-04-03	ujwal

	* Encoding list in drop-down menu is sorted.
	* Added support to specify path to nested bookmark in AppleScript.

2005-03-11	fabian

	* Updated zh_TW locale files.
	* Updated website files.
	
2004-12-18	fabian

2004-11-26	fabian

2004-11-20  ujwal

	* Re-organized some of the sizing code to make it work better when iTerm is embedded 
	  in other applications.

2004-11-14  ujwal

	* Re-organized some code.

2004-11-09  ujwal
	
	* Fixed more reverse video issues on OpenVMS: in [VT100Screen: -eraseInLine]; if 
	  entire line is erased, it gets default foreground and background colors.


2004-10-27  ujwal

	* Fixed bug in nested bookmark search.

2004-10-22	fabian

	* Updated Japanese nib files using translation provided by OHKAWA Yuichi.
	* Updated zh_CN, zh_TW, Japanese, Korean, French, German nib files for next controls.
	
2004-10-20  ujwal
	
	* Fixed more reverse video issues on OpenVMS: in [VT100Screen: -eraseDisplay], all 
	  erased characters get default foreground and background colors.

2004-10-20  ujwal

	* Fixed reverse video problem in OpenVMS again. Hopefully, this time it 
	  is the correct fix. In [VT100Screen: -scrollUp] and [VT100Screen: -scrollDown], 
	  new lines have DEFAULT_FG_COLOR_CODE DEFAULT_BG_COLOR_CODE for foreground and 
	  background colors respectively instead of using the terminal's current fg and bg 
	  colors. I am not sure why OpenVMS does not set the video properties appropriately 
	  when scrolling.

2004-10-10  ujwal

	* Added support to display Bookmarks in drawer of terminal window.

2004-10-03  ujwal

	* Periodically refreshing autorelease pool in display update thread to avoid 
	  memory leak from autoreleased objects.
	* Fixed code for numeric enter from \012 to \015.

2004-09-25  ujwal
	
	* Fixed problem when PTYSession: -keyDown is never called when numeric or function 
	  keys were pressed. This messes up switching between application and numeric 
	  keypad modes. Now PTYTextView: -keyDown: invokes PTYSession: -keyDown: when 
	  numeric or function keys are pressed.	  
	* Fixed printing to NOT wrap text.	
	* Added support to launch command line tools from Finder.

2004-09-12  fabian
	
	* More fix for "Font Size Follows Window Resize" option. Largely works now,
	  but maximization still has weird behavior sometimes.
	  
2004-09-07  ujwal

	* setHidden method is invoked only if target view supports it (>= 10.3).
	* Added keybinding action for numeric enter key.

2004-09-02	fabian
	
	* Added "Maximize Vertically Only" option.
	* Added "Font Size Follows Window Resize" option (not working well yet)
	
2004-08-30	fabian
	
	* Removed unused [PseudoTerminal setCharWidth:(int)width height:(int)height];

2004-08-04  ujwal

	* Cmd-click on selection is activated only if mouseDown and mouseUp are 
	  in the same location.

2004-07-07  ujwal

	  also fix any encoding issues.

2004-05-24  ujwal

	* Added support for services.

2004-05-19  ujwal

	* Made horizontal spacing parameter an "int" instead of a "float" since 
	  "float" was making the fonts look blurry. Spacing changes will be 
	  choppier, so we will need to revisit that.

2004-05-17  ujwal

	* Put back in fabian's fix for crash when closing window too fast. 
	  Object de-allocation does work correctly. It just happens when the 
	  next event is processed like a key or mouse event. However, it still 
	  leaves behind a zombie shell process that goes away only when iTerm 
	  is quit.

2004-05-15  fabian

    * Selection now occurs when mouseDown instead of mouseUp.
    
2004-05-11  ujwal
	
	* Added support to set cursor color and cursor text color from applescript.

2004-05-08  ujwal

	* Fixed printing.

2004-05-08  ujwal

	* Re-implemented display update thread using NSThread instead of NSTimer 
	  to avoid posting frequent events on main run loop. Hopefully this 
	  should reduce CPU usage seen on laptops. Also, the thread is called 
	  from the controlling Pseudoterminal instead of in each tab. Thread 
	  updates all tabs in the controlling PseudoTerminal. This should reduce 
	  the number of threads to one per PseudoTerminal.

2004-04-27  fabian

    * Added support for double/triple click and drag to copy.
    * Fixes for shift-to-extend-selection
    * Now Command-selection opens what is selected in a browser.
    
2004-04-26  ujwal

2004-04-18  fabian

    * Fix for dead key and related issues.
    * Fixes of Japanaese and German translatons.
    
2004-04-18  ujwal

	* Potential fix for dead key and key repeat issue.

2004-04-16  ujwal

	* Honoring anti-aliasing for bold also. We don't use strokewidth for 
	  bold when antialias is off since it looks ugly. Instead, we use 
	  the old method of redrawing the character offset by 1 pixel.
	  
	* Added a screen lock API to VT100Screen.

2004-04-15  ujwal

	* Fixed size of window in setWindowSize when tabs are at bottom.

2004-04-13  ujwal

	* Updated help pages.
	* Made changes to horizontal character spacing inconfig panel update smoother.

2004-04-11  ujwal
	
	* PTYTask is back to blocking read since we are not doing any 
	  idle processing anymore. This should cut down onthe number 
	  of select calls.

2004-04-11  fabian

    * Check in correct Japanese localization.
    
2004-04-11  ujwal

	* Made config panel a floating window. Changes are applied immediately 
	  to the active session.
	* Added back in support for bookmark shortcuts.

2004-04-10  ujwal

	* Removed obsolete code activating fonts.
	* Migrating name, command, and working directories of old 
	  addressbook to new format. Default profiles will be used.
	* Subclassed NSApplication to override sendEvent: so that 
	  custom key bindings with command key mask would work correctly. 
	  Take care not to define key mappings that override something 
	  important like cmd-q.

2004-04-08  ujwal

	* Updated ProjectBuilder file.

2004-04-06  fabian

	* Added more code for keybinding manager. Still incomplete.

2004-02-27 fabian

	  by adjusting position only for graphical glyphs, and NOT for ALL GLYPHS on 
	  in the line.
	  
	* iTerm's text system is the only supported one now since it is now proven to 
	  work well and much faster than Cocoa's default text system. You can switch to

    * Added some more scripting support to get and set the current 
      terminal.

2003-10-01	ujwal

2003-09-30	ujwal

    * All periodic timer code for each open session is called by a single 
      timer from PsedoTerminal. Thus there is one thread per window. 
      This should reduce the number of timer threads running and hence 
      lessen the load on the CPU.

2003-09-29	fabian

    * Fixed a bug in ANSICSI_ECH code. It shouldn't move cursor position.

2003-06-13	ujwal

    * Fixed bug in VT100Typesetter line bounds calculation where

      since that font provides all the glyphs.
      
    * VT100Terminal does not set NSCharacterWidthAttributeName for ascii text.
      This is so that the custom typesetter can easily check 
      for double width characters by just looking for the existence of the 
      attribute.
      
    * Created VT100LayoutManager, a NSLayoutManager subclass to speed up 
      some operations such as window resizing.

2003-06-09	fabian

        1. speed is much slower (~2x), 
        2. change font with a large scrollback buffer takes for
           ever (due to re-layout, I think).

    * Refresh now only updates the necessary part of screen
    
2003-03-26	ujwal

    * Created a new target "iTerm Framework" in the

      iTerm application target just contains the 
      entry point source file and images. It then

    * Updated Chinese nib files for new option.

2003-03-18	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>
    * Added explicit preference to warn on quitting 
      or closing a window/tab.
      
2003-03-14	fabian
    * Decrease the brightness of default color to give it
      more contrast to the highlight
    * Fixed a bug related to input CJK.
    * Updated Japanese nib files by Yuichi OHKAWA
    * Added a screen lock to prevent conflicting update.
    * Fixed a bug in dead key processing
      
2003-03-13	fabian
    * Added a new option to allow opening the bookmarks
      window when startup.

2003-03-12	fabian
    * Fixed a bug that causes incorrect process of color.
    * Cleaned up the color code
    * Fixed a bug related to reversed video mode.
    * Changed default black color to pure black.
    * Fixed some timer settings
    
2003-03-11	fabian
    * Changed the color code. Now we no longer have fixed
      bold text color. Instead, it's calculated from the
      base color. So we can choose whatever color we want
      again.
      
2003-03-10	fabian
    * Rewrite the color stuff in emulation code. Now we
      use seperate color table for normal and bold text.
      We now will using high color to indicate bold. Also,
      the color table will make the future implementation
      of customized ANSI color easier.
      Limitations: Any color you select for FG/BG will be
      converted to the closest color in the colorTable.
      Aslo, currently FG color will have no alpha.
    * Fixed a display problem when change FG/BG colors or
      Transparency.
    * Implemented ANSI code VPA and VPR, to fix one user's
      problem with Debian programs.
    * Fixed a blinking bug
    * Implemented ANSI code ECH
      
2003-03-10	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added some missing semi-colons in Chinese strings files.


2003-03-08	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed an issue where '=', '/', and '*' could not be 
      typed from numeric keypad. This was because those 
      keys were mapped to the PF2, PF3, PF4 keys. Now we 
      have a numLock state that is on by default. When 
      state is enabled, numeric keypad has the default 
      operation. When it is disabled, the keys 
      'numlock', '=', '/', and '*' send PF1, PF2, PF3, 
      and PF4 sequences. The state can be toggled by using 
      Cmd-numLock. This behavior is basically the same as 
      that implemented in GLTerm.
      

2003-03-04	fabian
    * Fixed a bug in screen update
    
2003-03-04	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

      enhancements and fixes for some bugs and memory leaks.
      

2003-03-02	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a screen update bug. Sometimes screen HAS to be 
      updated even if minIndex == [BUFFER length], e.g. when 
      doing ^u on the last line.
      

2003-03-01	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a warning bell orientation bug.
    

2003-02-28	fabian

      in BUFFER mode
      
2003-02-27	fabian
    * Fixed cursor code in ARRAY mode

      display should be fully working now
    * We now use the taller one between font and nafont to
      decide the lineHeight.
    * Fixed bugs in scrollUp and scrollDown in ARRAY mode
    * Added some #ifdef to make code compatible in BUFFER mode.
    
2003-02-26	fabian
    * Fixed general double-width character processing in ARRAY mode

      less portion of screen
    * Fixed a showCursor bug
      
2003-02-24	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added highly experimental code to do custom drawing 
      for high speed. Still very buggy. To enable the 
      code, turn on the USE_CUSTOM_DRAWING flag in 
      PseudoTerminal.m, turn on the DEBUG_USE_ARRAY 
      and turn off the DEBUG_USE_BUFFER flags in VT100Screen.m
      
    * Fixed a problem causing huge CPU usage when displaying 
      the bell in tab. Now displaying only if there is a 
      change.
      

2003-02-24	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed and simplified screen updating code.

    * Added an icon in Tab when a bell is received.
    * Now iTerm removes the warning icon when switching tabs.
    
2003-02-22	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a bug in resizing tabs and window when closing 
      a session.
      
    * Using smaller icon for popup menu in toolbar when 
      toolbar size mode is NSToolbarSizeModeSmall.
      
    * Further speed optimizations by caching rarely changing 
      character attribute dictionaries. We are also not 
      recreating our data stream in VT100Terminal every 
      time we pick off a token. That is too expensive. 
      We just mark our position in the stream and recreate 
      the stream only when we reach the end.
      

2003-02-21	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Manually firing screen update timer after a keyDown 
      to make user input more responsive.
      
    * Fixed memory leak by properly releasing BUFFER in 
      VT100Screen: -dealloc. Also no need to retain 
      BUFFER after alloc and init.
      
    * Fixed bug in accessing characters in buffer while 
      marking autowrap position.
      

2003-02-21	fabian
    * Fixed a bug in function key mapping: F1~F12
    * Fixed a bug in showCursor. Cleaned overall cursor
      Code.
    * Fixed bugs related to color/font settings in buffer

    * Perfromace improvement. Now a buffer is used in
      displaying the text. Significantly improve the
      overall speed. Need more test.
      
2003-02-20	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added and implemented tabViewWillPerformDragOperation 
      tabViewDidPerformDragOperation delegate methods. This 
      gets rid of a visual glitch when doing drag-n-drop 
      within a window with only two tabs.
      

2003-02-19	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added support for a few xterm character attributes.
    
    * Tabs are dragged only after about 8 pixels to prevent 
      accidental dragging.
    

2003-02-16	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Changed implementation of cursorToX: Y: and 
      cursorToX: in VT100Screen. Was interfering 
      with resize command.
      

2003-02-14	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed encoding bug in PTYsession: -keyDown:
    
    * Workaround for a possible Cocoa bug in copy/paste.
    
    * Changed keyboard shortcuts to navigate sessions

2003-02-13	fabian
    * Enhanced text input
    * Incorporated Japanese patch from OHKAWA
    
2003-02-12	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added preference to remap DELETE key to BACKSPACE.
    

2003-02-11	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Moved dead key code from PTYSession: -keyDown to 
      PTYTextView: -keyDown since that implements the 
      NSTextInput protocol.
      
    * Fixed a minor problem in VT100Screen: scrollUp 
      where an unwanted "\n" was inserted when 
      CURSOR_Y > SCROLL_BOTTOM.
      
    * Made flag to open session in new window in the toolbar 
      popup menu sticky.
      
    * Added GPL notice to all files.
      

2003-02-10	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added support for alternate keypad mode and 
      PF1, PF2, PF3, PF4 keys.
      
    * Fixed a bug in VT100Terminal: getCSIParam() 
      where the the paramters would be parsed into 
      incorrect array indices when blank (implied) 
      parameters were encountered. This is was messing 
      up some token processing where the position of 
      the parameters in the array was important like 
      [VT100Screen: -setTopBottom].
      
    * Fixed a cursor display bug in PseudoTerminal: -windowConfigOk.
      

2003-02-10	fabian
    * Cleaned up showCursor code
    * Incorparated Japanese nib files from OHKAWA
    * Fixed a bug in scrollUp
    
2003-02-09	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added drag-and-drop support to the PTYTabView class. 
      Tabs can now be moved within and between windows.
      

2003-02-07	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Workaround for a problem in Bookmarks where the 
      scrollbar was not being activated when it should have 
      been on load. It was being activated only on window 
      resize. Looks like a Cocoa bug, but I put in a 
      workaround of telling the NSTableView that the 
      number of rows had changed after loading the addressbook.
      
    * This time really fixed the cursor updating problem. 
      Root cause was VT100: -deleteCharacters that sometimes 
      caused OLD_CURSOR_INDEX to end up with the incorrect 
      value.
	

2003-02-06	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>
    
    * Now displaying tab number in label to make it easier 
      to switch between tabs using function keys.
      
    * Changed version number in Info.plist to 0.6.3.
      

2003-02-05	fabian
    * Fixed a bug in showCursor that causes the loss of
      attributes. That partially solves the double-width
      characters problem.
    * Localized new interface additions for zh_CN and zh_TW.
    * 0.6.3!
      
2003-02-04	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added menu item in tabview contextual menu to move 
      tab to new window.
      
    * Simplified PseudoTerminal code by removing direct 
      references to SCREEN, SCROLLVIEW, TEXTVIEW, TERMINAL, 
      TERM_VALUE. All these operate only on the PTYSession 
      object. Also simplified PseudoTerminal: -setupSession 
      code by moving a bunch of it into addSession which 
      is called by other stuff.
      
    * Fixed multi-line copy paste problem that was caused by
      line feed that is inserted when a command wraps over to 
      the next line. Now marking the position where the line 
      feed is inserted and removing it in the copy operation.
      

2003-02-03	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added submenus to tabview contextual menu. Tabview 
      contextual menu is now built and controlled by 
      the tabview delegate.
      

2003-02-02	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added basic Applescript support. One can now write 
      Applescripts to open one or more default or addressbook 
      sessions in a new tab or window. The syntax is:
      
      To open a new session in a new tab:
      launch session "<session_name>" in tab
      
      To open a new session in a new window:
      launch session "<session_name>" in terminal
      
      The <session_name> is either the name of a stored 
      addressbook session or "default session" for a 
      default session.
      
      Here is a sample Applescript:
      
      tell application "iTerm"
	activate
	launch session "default session" in tab
	launch session "Fink list" in terminal
      end tell
      
      These scripts can then be save as executable scripts.
      
    * Incorporated a modified patch by Aaron Gerber to escape 
      special characters out of a file name when doing a 
      drag-and-drop.
      

2003-01-31	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

      history
      

2003-01-30	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Removed terminal size constraints from Preferences, 
      Configuration panel, and Bookmarks entries. 
      Minimum size is 1x1.
      
    * We don't autoscroll to the bottom on shell output if 
      the user has scrolled up. Typing something on the 
      command line will trigger an autoscroll again.
      

2003-01-29	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Incorporated patch by Aaron Gerber to add a "Cancel" 
      button in the preferences panel.
      
    * Added preference to specify tab position:
      top, left, bottom, right
      

2003-01-27	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

2003-01-13	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added an option to copy selected text to emulate 
      X copy/paste. This requires a multi-button mouse 
      with one of the buttons programmed to be "Cmd-V" or 
      "paste".
      

2003-01-10	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Validating paste menu item only if there is a string 
      type on the pasteboard.

      and using original method.

    * Fixed some resizing issues by implementing 
      windowWillResize: toSize: window delegate method.
      
    * Default shell command is "login -fp $USER" to start 
      a login shell.
      

2002-12-30	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Setting TERM_PROGRAM environment variable to iTerm.app.
    
    * Added flag to disable anti-aliasing. Chinese NIBS need 
      to be updated.
    

2002-12-21	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added Save/Print functionality.
      Chinese NIBs and localized strings file need to be 
      updated.
      
    * Fixed some horizontal tabbing issues in VT100Screeen.
      Now pre-populating tab array with tabs every TABWIDTH 
      on init since we won't always get CSI_HTS command 
      before a tab is issued. Also ensuring that we move 
      to the next tab if we are already on one.


2002-12-20	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a bug that cause the tabview item label 
      attributes to be released when any session was 
      closed. Dictionaries had been static class variables 
      instead of belonging to specific instances.
      
    * Optimized code for setting tab label attributes so 
      that the drawing code is not called unnecessarily.

      window when the config session window was closed 
      even though the window sizes were not changed.
      
    * Fixed a window sizing problem that was evident in vi.
      I wish NSTabView would offer to calculate its frame 
      based on content size just like NSScrollView.
    

2002-12-19	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Re-implemented UI from button based to real-tab based 
      using NSTabView based on user feedback. Major code 
      changes and simplifications.
      
    * Fixed bug causing a crash when a session was closed 
      without the shell exiting with the "autoclose" 
      preference off.
      
    * Disabled the limit on the window size. Not sure why
      that was there.

2002-12-18	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Page up/down scrolling keys now need Shift key down 
      a la xterm since some programs like vi need to

2002-12-16	fabian

    * Updated strings files for Chinese
    
2002-12-16	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Removed addressbook toolbar item since the 
      addressbook popup menu gives similar functionality.
      Ideally, the icon for the popup button should be 
      the addressbook icon, but I couldn't get it to work.
      More research needs to be done on that...
      
    * Fixed bugs in iTermController that did not save addressbook

    * Refactored addressbook code by introducing an 
      "executeABCommand:" method in iTermController.
      

2002-12-11	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

      command-Fn: switch to n-th session

    * Rewritten all the encoding related code. Now all

      close an active session
    * session button uses gray to suggest the session has 
      ended, and session name is enclosed in []
    * fixed a bug in screenSizeInFrame() in VT100Screen.m,
      which makes row/col smaller than it should be
      (this one need more test)
      
2002-12-07	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Re-implemented transparency code to affect only text 
     instead of the whole window. Had to subclass NSWindow 
     since I ran into a nasty window redrawing Cocoa bug.
     
    * Instantiating scroll view in code rather than in NIB 
      to make layout look better.
      
    * PseudoTerminal is now a NSWindowController rather
