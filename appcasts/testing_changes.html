Alpha 13
This release includes the much-requested Visor-like hotkey feature plus an innovative new Autocomplete feature. There are plenty of bug fixes, too.

Enhancements
- Autocomplete: Do you find yourself using the mouse to copy and paste text all the time? No longer must you reach for the rodent! Just type the start of a word that has appeared in the current session (or appears anywhere in text that you've copy-pasted) and hit cmd-;. iTerm2 shows the words you might be looking for, and magically puts the best one at the top of the list!

Alpha 12
Featurepalooza! And bug fixes, too.

New features:
- Instant Replay: This feature makes iTerm2 behave like TiVo. You can press cmd-opt-b to step back in time and cmd-opt-f to step forward in time. If something is erased from the screen, it's no longer lost forever. This feature can be turned off in Preferences as it does take a bit of extra memory and has a small performance impact (less than 1%).
- Paste History: When you copy or paste text in iTerm2, it is now saved in the paste history. You can pop up a window at the cursor with cmd-shift-h which shows the last 20 strings in the clipboard. The list is searchable Quicksilver-style.
- Mouseless Selection: Do you often copy-paste text within the same window? Now you can do it without using the mouse. Open the findbar with cmd-f and search for the text you wish to copy. When part of the text is matched, use the tab key to expand the selection to the right by a full word and shift-tab to expand it left to the previous word boundary. It's automatically copied to the clipboard, or you can use opt-Enter to paste the selection immediately.

Enhancements:
- Findbar appearance improved.
- Add undo/redo to edit menu.
- Add zoom shortcut for cmd-opt-=.
- Read larger chunks from the network for better performance.
- Idle CPU usage reduced.

Alpha 11
Bug fixes! Also brings back i386 and PPC support. Details:

Fix bug where preferences toolbar button didn't match the displayed view (bug 42).

Alpha 6
This alpha introduces a complete reworking of the Preferences system. Profiles have been removed, as have hierarchical bookmarks. Bookmarks may now be annotated with tags (similar to Gmail labels), and are searchable. To make up for the lack of profiles, it is easy to copy classes of attributes (such as colors) from one bookmark to another. This UI should be considered experimental, and the design will continue to change as feedback is received.

Alpha 5
Bug 2: Redraw problems fixed (one was a race condition, other was a bug with clearing the bottom of the screen). Bug 20: Slowness on idle bug fixed. Bug 19: New selection mechanism: holding down alt selects a rectangular region. Inverted cursor support added. Add support for search-as-you-type for "find". URL detection improved.

Alpha 3
Fixed some warnings in PTYTask. Moved assertion in linebuffer per bug 9.
Fix a bug in the psmtabbar where they mutate an array while enumerating it. Also fix a race condition that caused Major fail! crashes or dereferencing free memory in PTYTask by properly locking the list of tasks and tolerating closed fd rather than hoping usleep prevents the race (hint: it doesn't)


Alpha 2
Added link to homepage.
Fixed some bugs with find. Changed credits. Updated Sparkle for the new site.
Rewrote find for better performance. Unicode not working so great now, though.


Alpha 1
