What is ``websockets``?
-----------------------

``websockets`` is a library for building WebSocket servers_ and clients_ in
Python with a focus on correctness and simplicity.

.. _servers: https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets/blob/master/example/server.py
.. _clients: https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets/blob/master/example/client.py

Built on top of ``asyncio``, Python's standard asynchronous I/O framework, it
provides an elegant coroutine-based API.

Here's a client that says "Hello world!":

.. copy-pasted because GitHub doesn't support the include directive

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import asyncio
    import websockets

    async def hello(uri):
        async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
            await websocket.send("Hello world!")

    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(
        hello('ws://localhost:8765'))

And here's an echo server:

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import asyncio
    import websockets

    async def echo(websocket, path):
        async for message in websocket:
            await websocket.send(message)

    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(
        websockets.serve(echo, 'localhost', 8765))
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()

Does that look good? `Start here`_.

Why should I use ``websockets``?
--------------------------------

The development of ``websockets`` is shaped by four principles:

1. **Simplicity**: all you need to understand is ``msg = await ws.recv()`` and
   ``await ws.send(msg)``; ``websockets`` takes care of managing connections
   so you can focus on your application.

2. **Robustness**: ``websockets`` is built for production; for example it was
   the only library to `handle backpressure correctly`_ before the issue
   became widely known in the Python community.

3. **Quality**: ``websockets`` is heavily tested. Continuous integration fails
   under 100% branch coverage. Also it passes the industry-standard `Autobahn
   Testsuite`_.

4. **Performance**: memory use is configurable. An extension written in C
   accelerates expensive operations. It's pre-compiled for Linux, macOS and
   Windows and packaged in the wheel format for each system and Python version.

Documentation is a first class concern in the project. Head over to `Read the
Docs`_ and see for yourself.

Professional support is available if you — or your company — are so inclined.
`Get in touch`_.

(If you contribute to ``websockets`` and would like to become an official
support provider, let me know.)

Why shouldn't I use ``websockets``?
-----------------------------------

* If you prefer callbacks over coroutines: ``websockets`` was created to
  provide the best corountine-based API to manage WebSocket connections in
  Python. Pick another library for a callback-based API.
* If you're looking for a mixed HTTP / WebSocket library: ``websockets`` aims
  at being an excellent implementation of :rfc:`6455`: The WebSocket Protocol
  and :rfc:`7692`: Compression Extensions for WebSocket. Its support for HTTP
  is minimal — just enough for a HTTP health check.
* If you want to use Python 2: ``websockets`` builds upon ``asyncio`` which
  only works on Python 3. ``websockets`` requires Python ≥ 3.4.
